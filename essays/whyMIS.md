I have recently decided to add MIS as my major in addition to Marketing and Chinese. What led to my decision? It was my recent study abroad to Hong Kong. I was on exchange to The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) and experienced the wonder of technology. Before heading to HKUST, I was already considering on adding MIS ad my major. What confirmed the decision was a class that I took on Network and Security during my exchange. The professor was very engaging and the course sparked my interest. In the course, I learned how a network is built and different things about the physical and logical addresses. This class made me realize the wonder of technology and the fun of learning it. 

Not to mention, in the modern society where everything persist to evolve and become more advanced, technology is and will continue to be an important factor to the rapid changes. I believe having MIS as my major in addition to my other majors in Marketing and Chinese will give me a competitive edge on analyzing the market and providing ideas that would put organizations ahead of the game. Also, I want to experience coding and see if it really is as bad as people made it sound like.
