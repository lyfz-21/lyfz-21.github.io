  <hr>
  <p>I have recently decided to add MIS as my major in addition to Marketing and Chinese. What led to my decision? It was my recent study abroad to Hong Kong. I was on exchange to The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) and experienced the wonder of technology. Before heading to HKUST, I was already considering on adding MIS ad my major. What confirmed the decision was a class that I took on Network and Security during my exchange. The professor was very engaging and the course sparked my interest. In the course, I learned how a network is built and different things about the physical and logical addresses. This class made me realize the wonder of technology and the fun of learning it.</p>

<p>Not to mention, in the modern society where everything persist to evolve and become more advanced, technology is and will continue to be an important factor to the rapid changes. I believe having MIS as my major in addition to my other majors in Marketing and Chinese will give me a competitive edge on analyzing the market and providing ideas that would put organizations ahead of the game. Also, I want to experience coding and see if it really is as bad as people made it sound like.</p>
