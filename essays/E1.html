  <p>With prior knowledge and experience in HTML, VS Code, CSS, and JavaScript, I was able to complete the three BrowserHistory WODs within the AV or Rx times. Though I was a bit rusty on the applications, I was able to get back on track after trying each of the WODs once and redoing them another time for better flow and get more familiar with them. The first WOD was the easiest out the three and I completed without any struggles as it didn’t involve any complicated JavaScript or CSS formatting of the web page. I attempted BrowserHistory twice because I forgot to speak out my thought process during the first recording. I had to keep on reminding myself to speak up during the recordings. For the second WOD, my first try was completed at Sd time because I forgot how to place the logos inline with the text and had to refer back to the reference pages to find out the code for executing the command. After figuring that out, I redid the WOD again was able to complete it under Rx time smoothly.</p>

<p>BrowserHistory3 got me by surprise as the first two WODs was relatively simple. When I was doing BrowserHistory3, I struggled to format the three columns in equal heights, which I believe many of my classmates did too. I had applied the same padding to all the columns, thinking that it will make all three columns align to each other. However, the third column was pushed down while the first two columns had equal spacing and are aligned. I had tried adding other spacing codes trying to bring the third column back up and switched the padding size, but no change was made to the last column. I was very confused on why the third column was pushed down and not aligning. Finally, I gave in and watched the screencast to see if I had made any mistakes. After watching the screencast, I was even more confused because what I did was how the sample solution was shown. I sat on my seat dumbfounded, and it wasn’t until a few minutes later that I realize the screenshot of how the web page should look like had what I placed as the last column as the center column. Upon the realization, I switched the codings for my center and last column around, and “wahla” everything was perfectly aligned. I guess the text for the center column was shorter than the third so it pushed the longer column down.</p>

<p>Watching the screencasts can be very helpful if one got stuck on a step and cannot move on. However, it is best to only watch until the step that we got stuck on and try the rest by ourselves. This way, we can practice what we have learned and know what we are good at or need more work on. Another advice to complete the WODs successfully is to preview or read the instructions with care before attempting the WODs. It saved me a lot of time since I was able to review resources needed for executing specific tasks and I can plan the steps out in my mind. Doing so helped me complete the WODs faster and not waste time struggling to understand what the written instructions meant. Not to mention, W3School was a great help when I didn’t understand what some of the tags or attributes do or when I had to troubleshoot something. It is great to get help from those who had faced the same problem and not just sit and stare at the computer screen feeling helpless.</p>
